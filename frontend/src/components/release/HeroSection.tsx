              <h4>Gene Ontology & Protein Function Prediction</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong>Gene Ontology (GO)</strong> is a structured vocabulary describing
                protein functions across three aspects: <em>Biological Process</em> (BP) describes
                large processes accomplished by multiple molecular activities, <em>Molecular Function</em> (MF) describes 
                molecular-level activities performed by gene products, and <em>Cellular Component</em> (CC) 
                describes the cellular location where a molecular function takes place.
                GO terms are organized in a directed acyclic graph where child terms inherit
                properties from their ancestors. If a protein performs a specific function,
                it implicitly performs all parent functions.
              </p>
              <p>  
                <strong>Protein function prediction</strong> is the computational task of assigning GO 
                terms to proteins based on various data sources such as amino acid sequence,
                3D structure, interaction networks, and literature. Accurate function prediction
                is crucial for understanding biology and disease, but it is challenging due to
                the vast diversity of protein functions and the incomplete nature of experimental annotations.
                The <strong>Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA)</strong> is a community challenge that evaluates
                computational methods for protein function prediction using a time-delayed evaluation framework.

              <h4>Evaluation of Prediction Methods</h4>
              <p>
                Predictions are evaluated on future annotations, which accumulate between two
                time points: <strong>Start (t0)</strong> when predictions are made, and <strong>End (t1)</strong> when new experimental annotations 
                accumulate. Longer windows provide a larger set of annotations and a more robust evaluation.
              </p>
              <p>  
                Predictions in protein-term-score format are compared with the corresponding protein-term 
                ground truth over score thresholds from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.01. This produces threshold-dependent <strong> 
                precision, recall, and F1 scores</strong>. CAFA-style evaluation also uses information-theoretic weighting 
                to emphasize the correct prediction of more specific terms.

            <div className="hero__learn-more-section">
              <h4>Knowledge Subsets</h4>
              <p>
                Proteins are classified by their annotation status at prediction time (t0) and 
                after the accumulation period (t1). The classification is crucial because methods 
                that rely on sequence homology or existing annotations may perform differently when 
                existing annotations are unavailable.

                    Proteins with no existing experimental GO annotations
                    at t0. This knowledge setting tests a method's ability to predict function purely

                    Proteins with experimental annotations at t0 in at least 
                    one GO aspect and gain additional aspects after accumulation period. Methods can leverage 
                    the existing annotations to predict additional functions in the remaining unannotated aspects.
